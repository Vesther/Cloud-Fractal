# A implementation of the Diamond-square algorithm in C++

This is a short C++ program which generates a random midpoint displacement fractal, also known as a Plasma/Cloud fractal using the [Diamond-square algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm).

The resulting image is displayed in a OpenGL/GLUT window and written to a [PGM file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format).

*Note*: Requires [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/).

Press **escape** to quit the program, press **space** to generate a new random fractal.
